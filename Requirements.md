## Functional Requirements

1. **User Management**:
    - User Registration: Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
    - User Login/Logout: Users can log in to and log out of the app.
    - Profile Management: Users can view and edit their profile information.
2. **Health Tracking**:
    - Meal Logging: Users can log their daily meals with details such as food items and quantities.
    - Exercise Logging: Users can record their exercise activities, including type and duration.
    - Water Intake Tracking: Users can track their daily water consumption.
3. **Nutritional Information**:
    - Food Database Access: Users can search for foods to find nutritional information.
    - Nutrient Tracking: The app tracks and displays nutrient intake based on meal logs.
4. **Community Interaction**:
    - Community Forum: Users can post, comment, and like in a community forum.
    - Sharing Features: Users can share their health achievements with the community.
5. **Notifications and Reminders**:
    - Daily Reminders: Users receive reminders for logging meals and water intake.
    - Achievement Notifications: Users get notifications for reaching health milestones.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**:
    - The app should load and respond quickly, with minimal latency.
    - Backend processes (like fetching data) should be efficient.
2. **Usability**:
    - The app should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
    - Navigation within the app should be straightforward.
3. **Security**:
    - User data, including login information and personal health data, must be securely stored.
    - Passwords should be hashed and secure authentication methods implemented.
4. **Scalability**:
    - The system should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of users and data.
5. **Compatibility**:
    - The app should be compatible with major browsers and mobile devices.

### Domain-Specific Requirements

1. **Health Data Compliance**:
    - Ensure compliance with health data regulations (like HIPAA, if applicable).
2. **Integration with External APIs**:
    - Integration with nutrition data APIs for accessing food information.
3. **Data Visualization**:
    - Visual representation of health data and trends (charts, graphs).

### Additional Considerations for UML Diagramming
- **Identify Classes and Objects**: Based on the requirements, identify potential classes (e.g., User, Post, Meal) and their attributes and methods.
- **Determine Relationships**: Understand how different classes interact and relate to each other (e.g., a User has many Meals).
- **Define Interfaces**: Identify any interfaces required, particularly for external API interactions.
- **Specify Use Cases**: Derive use cases for the key functionalities which can be represented in a Use Case Diagram.
- **Plan for Activity Flows**: Outline the flow of activities for critical processes like user registration or meal logging.
